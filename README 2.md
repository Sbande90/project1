# extendedplay
Extended Play is a web application which utilizes several API's to call information regarding bands and concerts within a specified radius. Results populate bio, discography, image, and closest event or events. Once events are listed, another listing will show nearest bars to venue, effectively "extending play" for your evening. Have fun, and play safe!
